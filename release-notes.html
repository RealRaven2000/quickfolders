<b>Improvements</b>
<ul>
  <li> 
   Continued work on <a href="https://quickfolders.org/premium.html#findRelated">find related mail feature</a> by adding a page in QuickFolders settings.

   Retrieve related mails in a folder through pattern matching on the currently selected mail.  <a href="https://github.com/RealRaven2000/QuickFolders/issues/488">[issue 488]</a>
    
   This works via a search mask (regular expression) that can read parts of the email and then set 
   a user defined quick search condition. I added a feature that resets the search when pressing 
   the Goto Next (unread) Email on the Navigation bar (current folder bar)
  </li>
  <li> Added icon to menuitem that gets messages. </li>
  <li> The API <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1909005">issue with Owl accounts not working</a> for license validation has been resolved by Thunderbird 128.2</li>
</ul>

<b>Bug Fixes</b>
