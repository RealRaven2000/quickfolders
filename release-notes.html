<b>Improvements</b>
<ul>
  <li> 
    New QuickFolders Pro feature: find related mails through pattern matching the currently selected mail.  <a href="https://github.com/RealRaven2000/QuickFolders/issues/488">[issue 488]</a>
    
    This works via a pattern search which is applied to fields of the currently selected email via a search mask (regular expression).
  </li>
  <li> 
    Added an option to hide the 'skip unread folder' button from the Navigation Toolbar.
  </li>
  <li> Improved tooltips in settings window. </li>
</ul>

<b>Bug Fixes</b>
<ul>
  <li>  Fixed: in Thunderbird 128 the notification popup for restricted features leads to an exception and may lead to failure of some features on systems without a Pro license. <a href="https://github.com/RealRaven2000/QuickFolders/issues/486">[issue 486]</a>    </li>
  <li> Fixed: Keyboard shortcuts (such as ALT+Left ALT+Right) stopped working in Thunderbird 128. <a href="https://github.com/RealRaven2000/QuickFolders/issues/491">[issue 491]</a>  </li>
</ul>

<b>Known Issues</b>
<ul>
  <li> 
    Currently the verification of QuickFolders licenses fails when the license is bound to an exchange account when it is accessed using Owl. This is due to a bug in the <a href="https://webextension-api.thunderbird.net/en/128-esr-mv2/accounts.html#accounts-api">extensions.accounts</a> Webextensions API - which doesn't include them when using <tt>accounts.list()</tt> - which we hope will be fixed very soon.
