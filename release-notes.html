<b>Bug Fixes</b>
<ul>
  <li> Fixed: notification popup for restricted features leads to exception + icon not displayed. <a href="https://github.com/RealRaven2000/QuickFolders/issues/486">[issue 486]</a> </li>
</ul>

<b>Known Issues</b>
<ul>
  <li> 
    Currently the verification of QuickFolders licenses fails when the license is bound to an exchange account when it is
    accessed using Owl. This is due to a bug in the <a href="https://webextension-api.thunderbird.net/en/128-esr-mv2/accounts.html#accounts-api">extensions.accounts</a> Webextensions API - which doesn't include them when using <tt>accounts.list()</tt> - 
    which we hope will be fixed very soon. 
  </li>
</ul>
