<b>Improvements</b>
<ul>
  <li> Made QuickFolders compatible with Thunderbird 128. <a href="https://github.com/RealRaven2000/QuickFolders/issues/454">[issue 454]</a>  </li>
  <li> Improved readability & layout for "newly arrived" mail - outlined instead of text shadow (biffstate - true) and added an option to disable special font.  <a href="https://github.com/RealRaven2000/QuickFolders/issues/468">[issue 468]</a>  </li>
  <li> Settings Advanced - Hardcoded Localisation for 'Open in New Tab' <a href="https://github.com/RealRaven2000/QuickFolders/issues/471">[issue 471]</a> </li>
  <li> QuickFolders now supports moving multiple selected folders with quickMove. This seems to work well when tested - also we should prevent the change icon menu in the folder pane popup when multiple folders are selected. <a href="https://github.com/RealRaven2000/QuickFolders/issues/475">[issue 475]</a>  </li>
  <li> Optimized licenser (omits folders while listing accounts) </li>
</ul>


<b>Bug Fixes</b>
<ul>
  <li> Ctrl+click on a subfolder should open new tab, this was fixed. <a href="https://github.com/RealRaven2000/QuickFolders/issues/474">[issue 474]</a>  </li>
  <li> Fixed file picker which is broken in Thunderbird 125 [bug 1882701] <a href="https://github.com/RealRaven2000/QuickFolders/issues/476">[issue 476]</a></li>
  <li> Fixed: quickMove doesn't fully complete on Tb 128 <a href="https://github.com/RealRaven2000/QuickFolders/issues/480">[issue 480]</a> </li>
  <li> Fixed:  Opening folder in Tab from menu (using CTRL + Click) - 
       search box was missing in new tab
    <a href="https://github.com/RealRaven2000/QuickFolders/issues/353">[issue 353]</a> </li>
</ul>

<b>Known Issues</b>
<ul>
  <li> Currently the verification of QuickFolders licenses does not work when the license is bound to an exchange account when it is
    accessed using Owl. This is due to a bug in the <a href="https://webextension-api.thunderbird.net/en/128-esr-mv2/accounts.html#accounts-api">extensions.accounts</a> Webextensions API - which doesn't include them when using <tt>accounts.list()</tt> - 
    which we hope will be fixed very soon.  </li>
</ul>
