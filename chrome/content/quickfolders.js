	Known Issues
	============
		Thunderbird 66 compatibility - more to do for 67! https://privatebin.net/?2c1a1bcc9bebca9c#9Z15ZXr7zj+AOM4CUMDyQBasYCRPb8or+X0nvYcxzHM=
	
		## To Do: without quickFilters installed - the filter mode icon is not 
		          working with full themes (TT deepdark) and neither is filter assistant triggered when a mail
							is dropped in the folder tree.
		## in some themes / languages the icons on the advanced options tab may appear stretched vertically
		   styling max-height for #mailCommandsCustomize .checkbox-icon will also negativeely affect the
			 height for the attached .checkbox-label causing vertical overflows
	  ## changing palette of uncolored folder doesn't update font color (test with TT deepdark)
    ## [Bug 26559] Drag Menu Item to toolbar not creating new QF tab  (Phoenity)
    ## [Bug 26560] Drag Current folder to toolbar not creating new QF tab  (Phoenity)
		## currently you can only drag single emails to a file using the envelope icon in Current Folder Toolbar.
		## when using the DOWN key to go to the search results of find folder, DOWN has to be pressed twice. (Tb+Pb only)
		## search in SeaMonkey delays highlighting the current tab when switching to the folder.
		## when deleting the current folder we should change into the parent folder to avoid confusion 
		##      at the moment we are in the folder after it's moved to trash which makes it look as if 
		##      it still a useful folder (Postbox)
